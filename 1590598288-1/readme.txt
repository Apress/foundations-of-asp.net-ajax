Foundations of ASP.NET AJAX
---------------------------


If you plan on using Visual Studio 2005 Ajax enabled Web Applications be sure to install ASP.NET Ajax after installing Visual Studio 2005 SP1.


The ASP.NET Ajax Control Toolkit can be downloaded at http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkitT along with  instructional videos. You can also obtain the latest source code and join discussions on the latest release and issues at CodePlex (http://codeplex.com).


The majority of chapter 6 discusses Scott's ToDoList application which you can download  in addition to video tutorials about this and other ASP.NET Ajax topics on http://ajax.asp.net

Chapter 8, the second part of the Ajax Control Toolkit coverage, mostly sites examples from the online samples available at http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples.  Beyond that, all other source files are included in the Chapter08 folder.
